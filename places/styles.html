<h1>BLOCK ELEMENT!!!</h1>
<ol><li> A BLOCK level element, by default, takes up all the space 
        to the right and left internal to its parent.</li>
    <li> A BLOCK CAN have height and width. If you change the width, 
        it will just add margin. </li> 
    <li>It  will ignore the margin you add, 
        because they're already 100%.</li>
    <li>Can be greater than 100%.</li></ol>
<div id ="block-wrapper">
    <div id="block1" class = "block"></div>
    <div id="block2" class = "block"></div>
    <div id="block3" class = "block"></div>
</div>
<ol>
    <li>Respect left and right padding, left and right margin
        but will ignore top and bottom.</li>
    <li>Couldn't care less what is left or right.</li>
    <li>With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline
        element how big to be.</li>
    <li>Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Inline block:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Can have stuff on either side (inline positive)</li>
    <li>Can have height/width (block positive)</li>
    <li>Can have top/bottom padding/margin (block positive)</li>
</ol>
